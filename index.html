Wondering where Belle comes from? Disclaimer: it is not nearly as extraordinary. Simply put, one of my older sisters really liked Beauty & the Beast when I was born. Luckily for me, the name is just as fitting. I am a Nigerian-American person born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia - a real southern Belle. I moved to NYC in Fall of 2021 to attend undergraduate at New York University. I major in Public Policy and Computer Science, and I minor in Film and Creative Writing</p>
